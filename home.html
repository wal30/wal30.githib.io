<p>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has not always been the vibrant city it is today. During the 20th century, Pittsburgh was known for its steel work and supply. During WWII Pittsburgh was the source of steel essential for fighting the war. This is where the name "Steel City" emerged. To this day, people still have the preconceived notion that Pittsburgh is still this dirty old steel town. The saying dont judge a book by its cover is essential to this city. With the 21st century came a new face for Pittsburgh. Considered today one of the most livable cities in the United States, Pittsburgh now displays its beauty and affordability through modern, quirky museums and uniquely different neighborhoods! There is something to be said about a city breaking the mold, and Pittsburgh does just that!</p>
