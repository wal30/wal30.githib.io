<p>There are so many things that Pittsburgh, PA has to offer. But things don't make up a city, the neighborhoods and the people do! There are so many different neighborhoods that make up this fantastic city and it is impossible to properly describe them, you must see them for yourself. </p>
      <p> To help you out, here are a few of my favorite places: </p>
      <span class="site-footer-owner">Shadyside</span>
      <p> If you are looking for a neighborhood of tree-lined streets, historic homes, hip events, boutiques, shops, galleries and distinctive restaurants, then Shadyside is the place to be! And most everything is within walking distance. The large residential area includes beautifully restored Victorian mansions alongside modern homes and condos. This East End neighborhood is conveniently located about six miles from Downtown and provides a plethora of things to occupy your time! </p>

      <span class="site-footer-owner">The Strip District</span>
      <p> The Strip is perfect if you are searching for great food at an even better price! It is home for some authenitc foodie fun while also providing a place for someone to get a fantastic cup of coffee. The Strip District seeps local flare and is a great place to observe some Yinzers! </span>

      <span class="site-footer-owner">Mt. Washington</span>
      <p> If you want to see a panoramic view of this wonderful city, than Mt. Washington is definently a neighborhood to stop by. There are vantage points of the city all along Grandview Avenue and there are fantastic upscale resturaunts that let you dine while looking at the beautiful pittsburgh skyline! The views at the top of the mount are absolutely unbeatable!</p>
